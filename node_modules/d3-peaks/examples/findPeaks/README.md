This example illustrates how to use the findPeaks API.
You can download the library from [https://github.com/efekarakus/d3-peaks](https://github.com/efekarakus/d3-peaks).

The algorithm is based on "Improved peak detection in mass spectrum by incorporating 
continuous wavelet transform-based pattern matching" by Pan Du, Warren A. Kibbe and Simon M. Lin.
